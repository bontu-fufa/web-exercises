        <p class=title>CSS units(%,em,rem,px) and reponsivness </p>
        <article>
            <p>Inorder to compare these units let's consider each one by one</p>
            <h3>Pixels</h3>
            <p>Using font-sizes, element sizes and spacing in pixels is like treating the web as there is only one end user which is the developer.

                In most browsers, a user can set their default browser font-size to be a different size to the default (typically 16px). 
                If the user sets their default to some size by increasing or decreasing it , all font-sizes should scale accordingly.
                
                However, if the website explicitly sets font-sizes in pixels, a heading set at the original scale will always be the same.
                That might sound great from a designer/developer point of view but, it depends on the end user.
                In these case the users can still zoom in and out to get there preferable view.</p>
            
            <h3>EM</h3>
            <p>
                For values given with em, it is equal to the computed size of that element’s parent. 
                To illustrate this,  If there is a div element defined with font-size: 16px 
                then for that div and for its children 1em will be computed as 16px.
                If font-size is not defined explicitly, that element will inherit it from the parent element.
                The inheritance continues to take place this way amongst ancestors up until the root element. 
                Default font-size of the root element is provided by browser and it is usually 16px.
                using em will make some trouble by compounding when multiple em-font-sized elements
                are within one another. This can become a problem and can lead to unintended consequences in the designs.
            </p>
            <h3>REM</h3>
            <p>Values given in rem are relative to the root html element, not to the parent element. 
                That is, If font-size of the root element is 16px then 1 rem = 16px for all elements and if it is 2rem = 32px.
                If font-size is not explicitly defined in root element then 1rem will be equal to the default font-size provided
                by the browser which is usually 16px.
                When it comes to spacing and font-sizing it is preferable to use rem. 
                Since rem uses root element’s font-size instead of its parent’s font-size.
                unlike em , using rem units allow us to avoid the compounding effect of em units.
                With rem things are always and consistently based on the font-size or the root element, so there are no surprises no trouble.
                
            </p>
            <h3>%</h3>
            <p>
                Using % sor spacifying values, is one of a solution for responsiveness.
                As mentioned earlier the default font-size of most browsers is 16px. 
                For example setting font-size: 100% will make 1rem = 16px. 
                But a better way is to set font-size: 62.5%. Because 62.5% of 16px is 10px. Which makes 1rem = 10px.

        <p class=title>Browser interpretation when default value(16px) changed to 200px</p>
        <article>
            <p>
            First of, every display panel is made up of a series of dots called pixels, and
            the more pixels , the more detail can fit on-screen. 
            So as the resolution increases the size of each pixle decreases and the sharper the dispaly will be.
            There fore, when the default browser increases or decreases this the dot size decreases or increases respectivelly.
            This will change the appearance of the display accordinglly.</p>
            <p>
            In other case it is obvious that the default values of browsers can be different as per there type, 
            let's take most used default value 16px. If in any case there is no font size change in the browser 1em = 16px.
            But when web is developed the size we prefer can be 200px or 300px or any size. 
            Therefore when we set our own prefered size let's say 200px now 1em = 200px, then the styling 
            will be callculated with the new setted value.        
            </p>

        <p class=title>Specific changes in CSS3</p>
        
        <article>
            <h3>CSS Animations and Transitions</h3>
            <p>
                There are two ways to create CSS animations. 
                The first is very easy, it is done through animating the changes of CSS properties with the transition declaration. 
                With transitions, you can create hover or mouse down effects, or you can trigger the animation by changing the style of an element with JavaScript.
                The second way for defining animations is a bit more complicated - it involves the description of specific moments of the animation with the code>@keyframe rule. 
                This allows you to have repeating animations that don't depend on user actions or JavaScript to get triggered.
            </p>
            <h3>Calculating Values With calc()</h3>
            <p>It allows to do simple arithmetic calculations in CSS. 
            Can be used anywhere a length or a size is required. 
            What is even cooler, is that mixing different units is possible, like percentages and pixels. 
            This makes a lot of layout hacks that you might have used in the past obsolete.</p>
            <h3>Webfonts</h3>
            <p>
            Services like Google Fonts and typekit, which let us to embed beautiful fonts by simply including a stylesheet in our page. 
            There are even icon fonts like fontawesome, which contain pretty vector icons, instead of letters or numbers. 
            This was all made possible by the code>@font-face rule, which lets us to define the name, characteristics and source files for fonts, 
            which we can later refer in our font/font-family declarations.
            </p>
            <h3>Box Sizing</h3>
            <p>
                The biggest consept in CSS is the box model-the CSS width and height of an element affected by its padding and borders. 
                This little feature breaks layouts, but finally there is a way to restore our sanity by using the box-sizing rule. 
                We can set it to border-box, which makes elements behave exactly the way you expect.
            </p>
            <h3>Multiple Backgrounds</h3>
            <p>
                With multiple backgrounds, designers can achieve very interesting effects. 
                They can stack different images as backgrounds of the same element. 
                Each image (or layer) can be moved and animated independently.
                 All background-releated CSS rules can now take a comma-delimited list of properties, 
                 each for the specific background image.
